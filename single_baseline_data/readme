This is a small example on how flagging affects estimation of HI 21 cm power spectrum.

Here the data folder contains the simulation of a single baseline data os SKA-1 low, with the sky model- HI cube + point sources, at z=9

The data does not contain noise, hence simple squaring the visibility will give Power Spectrum (after propoer scaling). 
The entire methodology is based on Parsons.et.al 2012,2014. 

All the relevant functions are defined in functions.py

If one follow the clean_ps_single_baseline.py file and run this on ipython/python or Jupyter notebook, then it will work and all the relevant images will be generated.
Those images will be stored into data folder. 

I have already run this and stored the images in the image folder here.
