The clean_ps_parallel.py file will load the data (fits format or simple binary file), choose random channels and flag those, then apply CLEAN (1D) algorithm 
 parallely on baselines (choose the number of cores avaliable) and store the CLEAN delay spectrum in pkl files.

I have tested this with simulated SKA-1 low data set with HI_Cube + point source as the sky model. 

The data set is huge, so unable to upload.

However, one can simulate any telescope array with a sky model using CASA/OSKAR (or any other simulator) and do this exercise.

The fits data can be loaded and stored using pyuvdata tool. 

All the relevant functions to do this task is situated in the functions.py. 

Although the data set may be huge, but given the number of cores available one can run this CLEAN task parallely.
